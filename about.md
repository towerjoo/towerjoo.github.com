It is contradictory for me regarding privacy and share. I love to share a lot of things to others whatever it's about my profession or it's a book. It's obvious that we are becoming more distant with privacy when leaving more footprints in the web.

While there's never a black or a white, it's always grey, which means I might tend to stay where I am now while struggling to keep a good balance.

I wrote a post about [why this blog](/_posts/2020-02-07-why-blog.md) and also has a [Chinese blog](https://towerjoo.github.io/).

If you want to reach me, check out the social handlers in the left panel of the web page.

Finally I want to quote the famous poem I love so much by *Robert Frost*

```
The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
```
