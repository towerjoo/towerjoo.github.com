Walking around on the streets, or surfing around on the Internet, there are always some random thoughts
springing out, which usually hold me closely and the typical outcome is that I have to read
more about that to know the existing research on that, or I have to quit entirely.

## Left wing and right wing

We always talk about left and right, or liberal and conservative. But going through their essential points,
who can fall totally in either wing? I might be a bit center leaning left if I have to choose the side.

But what do they really mean? why human beings got separated into two groups? why such two groups apply for
so many countries/peoples? 

Those questions just push me to read more about this subject.


## Ruling a company versus ruling a country

That a country is so similar to a company is always haunting around my head, whatever its managing(or ruling)
approaches, its rewarding/punishing policies, its power transfering, etc.

For a company, we think it makes sense to allow the founder to transfer its ownership to his/her children. But
when it comes to country, we think it doesn't make sense at all which is totally monoarchy and counter-democracy.

For a company, seems we don't like democracy at all, and we prefer the fast and dictator way, like Apple's Jobs, who
can give the right solution without holding many meetings.
when it comes to country, we don't like it, and we favor the equality/fairness over efficiency.

For a company, a person gets promoted typically because he did a really good job to the company's revenue(or the stakeholder's
interest). 
when it comes to country, we hope the official can do a good job for the public instead of his upper level manager. And we don't
hope he got raised because he just brought interest to the powerholders.

So maybe in most perspectives, we cannot simply compare company and country, due to their different scale. But can we compare
giant company with a country, e.g Facebook versus UK? Huawei versus China?

I don't know. And I should read more about this, and it's obvious that there exists lots of researches about the company management
and country management, and also the comparison between the two subjects.
