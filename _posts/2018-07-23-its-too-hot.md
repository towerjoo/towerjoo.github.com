Days ago, when my wife, my daughter and I walked along The Big Wild Goose Pagoda(大雁塔),
my daughter asked, "how to say 我很热"? My wife replied, "I am very hot". After hearing that,
I just bursted into laughter. And I told them, "hot is kind of confusing, and when you use that word,
you need to be careful, and when you say somebody is hot, mostly it means they are sexy; if you want to
say 我很热, you can say it's very hot or you feel very hot"

Here, I detailed this conversation, because I want to focus on the differnce between two languages. Sometimes
Chinese tends to be confusing, or ambiguous, or inaccurate, e.g easy v.s simple, fast v.s quick, etc.

So, it becomes very hot now, and we can only stay in house with AC on. We go to the bookstore in qujiang to
enjoy its cool temperature with a lot of books, and we go to the mountains to enjoy the water downhill, and play
with the water, even with a watermelon cooling inside. So we just try to figure out some ways to hide from the
high temperature with natural power, or human power. But without a doubt, in summer, we just lose some of our
productivity for the temperature, e.g it just becomes much harder to focus on, or you have to drink more water,
or sometimes the temperature by AC just goes too low, etc.

So I always say that I prefer winter to summer, because at least I can focus on what I want and be of high productivity.
