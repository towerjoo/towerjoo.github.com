It is a very thick and dense book, with hundreds of pages, which I bought from 
Hongkong two years ago. It's always easy to buy books and difficult to really finish
it. So it was dusted in the corner of my study for a long time until a foreign friend
asked me to recommend a Chinese book to him. So I lent this book to him even though I
had no chance to go through myself.

One random line from that friend just forced me to pick the book again: "Maybe we can discuss
the book once I finish it".

I got my kindle version too so I just started to read.

## History and memoir

Due to my science background, I barely believe in the absolute truth, or any genuine history. But
you shouldn't mistake me as believe-in-nothing, while I prefer to say I view things in critical way
i.e whatever who wrote what, it's always biased in some way, and it's always lacking information from
some angle.

Just like walking along the street, a robbery took place, in your view it might be like this with missing
a lot of information, while others might state very differently from yours, which doesn't mean you or he
doesn't hold the truth. The more careful words to put might be: you both hold only part of the truth.
But if truth contains thousands of angles, who can hold the whole truth?

So I don't believe in history or at least I just assume it's one way to put the history, and in the meantime there're
many alternatives available somewhere which are also justified.

I prefer memoir comparing to history, which at least doesn't claim that's the whole truth, while it modestly hints
that that's only the author's own point of view in his/her own angle.

## Truth

That part of Chinese history is rarely accesible to public. What happened, who made the decisions, who should take
the responsibility, why it did happen, how to prevent its next possible happening, are all beyond our reach.
When that generation of people pass away, we don't have any chance to get the one-hand information any longer. That
might be a huge pity when we look back years later. So it just makes these very few books about those years so important
and valuable and precious.

Let bygones be bygones. 

Sometimes we don't want to retaliate to make fair by exposing the truth. Mostly we just felt panic about what had happened
and deeply concerned that might happen again. I always believe that system is more reliable than people esp. on ruling a country.
But once it's written on the papers, there's no loopholes or flixible decisions to be drawn by the officials which is obviously
something the power-holders are not expecting. But who can ensure they or their descendants can still hold the power? Once you
are an ordinary citizen, you absolutely prefer a more fair system instead of people who own so much space to decide or exploit
or abuse.

Not only about power-holders, it's also about the public. It turns out that we are all very easy to be manipulated, and we don't 
care so much about our fellows or even relatives, families. We are stupid and promptly led by our instinctive. And we hurt
others in some cruel manners without any guilt or regrets, esp. when the behaviors are not alone. So for me, I am deeply concerned
we might be manipulated again to throw over some or even ourselves which just makes living a peaceful life impossible.


## Then?

I checked the reviews from Douban about this book, which are filled with curses against the author. And that just made me sadder
because most of us even couldn't distinguish A from B, and we just messed up so many things together. I might hold the intense
hatred against the author if I was beaten by her during that time. But I would think more and deeper. And who should be the biggest
responsibility-taker?

I feel sorry for the author, her family and her life. And I also feel sorry for the reviwers, the present society, the lack
of knowledge, the hide of truth, and the possibility of similar things to happen.
