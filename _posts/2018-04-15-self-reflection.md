avc blog's author Fred Wilson writes posts every day for years without any interruption.
As he mentioned it's just like a history recorder or something to reflect himself or his decisions.

I cannot agree more with him. Nowadays, under such a overwhelming information age, we're so scared to be
forgotten behind, so we consume so much information each day, whatever it can benifit you or not. So as 
someone mentioned about productivity, the first thing is to assure that the direction is correct, or
whatever your speed it might lead you to a worse condition. And such a blog-writing can benifit you so much
about self-reflection, at least it can remind you to rethink your real goal.

I might not be able to keep writing in the daily manner, but weekly seems more doable for me. So I add the 
weekly writing to my reminder.

The content might be about self-reflection as I mentioned, or some interesting stuffs happened, or something 
I read that might be helpful to share, or even some findings around myself. Sometimes it might be like rambling, 
sometimes it might be very serious and logical.

Last week, I started to read more books instead of consuming articles. This change seems helpful so far, for the books'
more logic/systematic arrangement of content, which means the authors are more careful about his writing. So in the long run,
it might be the best way(i.e effective and efficient) to build a solic knowledge for any field. I also started reading some
novels, e.g a Japanese novel, and a Chinese novel. For a long time, Japanese and Russian literatures are two of my favorites, since
seems they touch things more deeply or even recklessness(the dark side of human beings). You just find yourself there, and
not just a reader but also a participant. While for Chinese novels, it's often more relevant to my own life, since they just cover
the things around us, maybe it's not that deep(for the government's scrutiny policy), but it's always that vivid.

My English learning is still under way, and it will continue until I feel good enough. The biggest issue so far is not listen, but
speaking, which means so far I still find it difficult to pick the right word when expressing something. Sometimes you just cannot
get the right accurate word in time, which means they just jump up later. Another problem is that I stll feel so nervous when talking
in public(it is not necessary to be 100 persons, but 10 persons might scare me to death to give a speech). This is something I am trying
to address, and so far it's not yet on the degree of comfort.

More workouts are also something I want to mention here. 5-6KM everyday can give a quick refreshment after a long day's work. Running 
along with listening some good podcasts is alwalys something I enjoy so much. Looking at so many young faces(I often run in the playground
of a university), it always give me inspiring and makes me feel younger. I love that feeling.
