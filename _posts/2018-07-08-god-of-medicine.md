I am a movie maniac undoubtedly, which I nearly love everything about movies. But I am
also picky about movies, and that's why I prefer to check the rate or review without spoiling before watching.
And after watching, I enjoy reading some great reviews or podcast made by film experts, which always broaden
my view to the movie, even we don't always agree that much.

Movie is something fascinating, esp. in nowadays, because, it might be very few  things you can immerse yourself
into for 2 hours without any distraction, which means it can achieve or affect the audience in some way deep.
So we talk the aims of movies, or their responsibilities. IMO, it is just like books, and what the aims of books
should also apply to movies. So you cannot say movies are only about entertainment, while it must hold some responsibilities
of the society, religion, or humanity. Due to the policy of China, we might not be able to talk about some topics, 
but it's always a good thing to talk about the reality of our society, and not just about some sci-fi, old days, etc, even
they are good filmed.

What I want to say is about a new movie, which is about the cancer and its healing medicine, which is too expensive to be affordable
by the patients, so a guy just trys to smuggle the pirate medicine from India and sells in Shanghai without the purpose of
earning money but saving others. So it raises a harsh question: facing the possible death, is that morally and legally correct to
smuggle and sell the pirate medicines to the patients without profiting? It's a hard question, because it's not always a question
that we should complain the drugs makers or the drug dealers(or even smugglers), but IMO we should ask the government to lead and
find a way to balance the interests of each part, or even spend more money(from taxpayers) to save those lives.

Such movie is good, even it just tries to mix the boundary between ethic and law; or even it tries too hard to make you cry; or
it exploits the conflict between citizens and the officials. I love this movie and its effect to make us think more about our
country and some people with bad luck.

Hope they can be better day by day, with cheaper but more efficient drugs, with better policies, with better help from others,
with less pain.
