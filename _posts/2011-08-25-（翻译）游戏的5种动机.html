<h1>正文</h1>
The 5 Motivations In no particular order:

Relationship: This factor measures the desire to develop meaningful relationships with other players in the game - usually in the form of a supportive friendship. Players who score high on this factor usually make good friends online, and tend to have meaningful conversations with their online friends, which usually involves talking about real-life personal issues. In times of need, these players can usually count on their online friends for emotional support. These players also tend to feel that they have learned things about themselves from playing the game, as well as gaining a better understanding of real-life group dynamics.

Immersion: This factor measures the desire to become immersed in a make-believe construct. Players who score high on this factor enjoy being immersed in a fantasy world they can wander and explore. They tend to role-play their characters, and use their characters to try out new personalities and roles. They enjoy being in the company of other role-players. They also appreciate the sense of being part of an ongoing story, and oftentimes will think up a personal history and story for their characters.

Grief: This factor measures the desire to objectify and use other players for one's own gains. Their means may be both outward or subtle. On the outward side, they may enjoy dominating other players by killing them on the battlefield, or by taunting and annoying them. On the more subtle side, they may enjoy manipulating other players for their own gains, such as deceiving other players through clever scams, or begging for money and items. In either case, the satisfaction comes from some form of manipulation of other players for personal gain.

Achievement: This factor measures the desire to become powerful within the construct of a game. Players who score high on this factor try to reach the goals as defined by the game. They try very hard to accumulate rewards. For example, they try to optimize their XP gain to reach the next level as quickly as possible. Or they may try to accumulate as much high-level gear as possible. Or they enjoy doing massive amounts of damage to mobs. The underlying theme is a desire to get bigger numbers. But the satisfaction comes from feeling powerful.

Leadership: This factor measures the gregariousness and assertiveness of the player. Players who score high on this factor prefer to group rather than solo. They are often assertive individuals and usually drift to leadership positions when in a group. Because a group led by an indecisive leader often gets fragmented, the assertiveness of these players probably allows them to be effective group leaders in the game.

游戏的5种动机

下面5种动机没有先后顺序：

社交关系：这个因素衡量的是玩家对于在游戏中与其他玩家建立有意义的社交关系的诉求－通常是一种互助的关系。得分高的玩家 通常会赢得更多好的线上朋友，并且通常与线上朋友的交流更加有趣和有意思，话题也会包含真实生活中的个人事情。随着交流 的加深，这些玩家也会将其线上好友视为情感的寄托。这些玩家也会更加觉得从游戏中学到了有意义的事情，并且对于真实世界的 人际交往特点有了更深的认识。

沉浸感：这个因素衡量的是玩家在虚拟世界中沉浸的程度。得分高的玩家非常享受在这样的虚拟世界里徜徉和探索。这些玩家会更加 投入到自己的角色里，并且基于这个角色来体验新的性格和身份。他们享受与其他玩家并肩战斗的感觉。他们也很推崇自己是进行中 的故事中一员的感觉，有时也会为自己的角色构思出历史和故事。

控制欲:这个因素衡量玩家利用其他玩家来达成自己利益的诉求。这些行为或者显性或者隐性。显性方面，他们可能觉得在战场上通过杀戮,捉弄或者干扰 别的玩家而获得的控制感很爽，隐性方面，他们会通过巧妙的骗局，乞求金钱或者装备而欺骗别的玩家获得自己的利益，他们会 觉得这个过程很爽。无论那种形式，这种满足感都来自于某种形式的控制欲。

<a href="/assets/images/grief.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-239" src="/assets/images/grief.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>
成就：这个因素衡量在游戏的虚拟世界里对于权力的诉求。得分高的玩家努力完成游戏设定的目标。他们尽力收集各种荣耀和奖励。例如，他们尽力 优化自己的经验增加值，以期让升级越快越好。或者他们努力的收集更高级别的装备。或者他们非常享受大面积的破坏力。本质的目标是对于获得 更高数值的诉求，但是满足感来自于权力的感觉。

领导：这个因素衡量对于玩家的群体认同感的诉求。得分高的玩家更喜欢群体作战而不是单兵作战。他们经常是非常自信的人，并且当处于一个 部落是非常热衷于领导职位。因为由一个优柔寡断的人领导的群组会比较松散，这些玩家的自信通常能够让他们胜任游戏中的领导职位。
