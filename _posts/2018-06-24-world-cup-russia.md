Sometimes I just found myself to engage with so many things, which all seem to interesting to me, not just
about reading(e.g literature, philosophy, law, economics, etc.), and also sports(NBA, soccers, badminton, tennis, etc.).
So I kinda get filled with watching some good matches in my spare time for leisure, and sometimes even get overwhelmed.

Russian world cup is still in fire. And as a big fan of Ronaldo, I don't want to miss any of his matches, even that one might
be live at 2am. So far it's good, because he just performed greatly, and the match itself was so awesome. In contrast, some guys
just complained about Messi's poor performance. I don't want to say too much about these two superstars, but I really want to say
something in general.

We really care more about a person's attitute and the real performance in the match(or job, or exam, or anything). Maybe he is not
that gifted, he can gain compliment with his hard working and best will for triumph. So does the opposite. You will disppoint your fans
your family your friends without fighting but giving up even you are so smart and gifted.

I guess that's why Ronaldo just gained so much appreciation.

As a mediocre person, for most cases, we even don't need to use our gift and the effort you paid can make you outstand, while most guys
just fail by not giving their best shoot.

Let's see who will win finally.
