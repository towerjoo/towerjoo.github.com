Microsoft acquires github for 7.5B, which is a very huge money, but for the customers of github
besides congrats and envy, we also become more concerned about our code safety. This safety is not
about whether it will get lost perminently, but it's about the possible scrutiny. This kind of careful
reading/checking will make me really upset, even though it's just a hypothesis.

Source codes are so important and stand so much value for a company. And at the mean time, with the significant improvement
of machine learning, going through all the codes once to find something interesting will become so cheap, even
they might claim it's just used in anonymous way, while the ideas can be stolen whatever it's anonymous or not.
Before, I learned a lot from one MS paper about code generation using ML, and it's amazing. Even though MS is a giant
and has a huge codebase, but it's still hard to compare with github's hosting codebase. With this treasure in house, 
who, as a reasonable/logical/selfish man, will not try to give it a glimpse?

We often say, "ideas are cheap, show me the codes". With acquiring github, they'll be able to copy your codes(or product) 
easily, even Bill Gates has retired for years.

Gitlab will get more attention, but for its own similar machanism, they just have the exactly same inherent flaw. So we need to
touch the root, which is to have something that is distributed and crypted in the mechanism, and cannot be checked by anyone without
the right authorization. That's why we should go to some way similar to IPFS, i.e github+blockchain. When it gets mature(i.e speed,
stability, accessibility, etc), it should be the way to go.

I hope this can be done by someone.
