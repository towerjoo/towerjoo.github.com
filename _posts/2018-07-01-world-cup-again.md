Last night, the most important two games for me were played because of Messi and C. Ronaldo.
These two guys are reckoned as two kings of soccer, but they are so different in physical strength,
playing skills, and personalities. I am more a fan of Ronaldo, which seems to be something our ordinary
people can become with our hardworking, while Messi seems to be more gifted by nature and more like an
alien to keep me with a certain distance.

Whatever Messi or Ronaldo, soccer is not just one man game, and it requires 11 people's effort and commitment, so
whether you can win depends on the whole team in most cases, so the both teams the two kings are in just got beaten
by the opponents, and they just had to leave Russia to return. This sounds like a sad news for me as a big fan for
them, while after watching the two games, I am not disappointed, since what you can see from the playing is
the passion and never-give-up spirit, which are more important. And the two kings just did very well in that sense.

So they left at the age of 31 and 33 respectively, new guys have come to the stage for their own debut, and some did
really great, e.g Mbappe. His dribbling, speed are so great and also great pass by teammates, so he has the chance to
give a remarkable show. I told my friends, "if there's a guy in Portugal who can gives great pass, Ronaldo can do this
kind of performance even better." But that is just an if.

The people who can inspire others are the ones who are close to our ability(or even inferior to normal people) but make
great success with their hardworking and perseverance. That kind of people are good examples for us, and make us want
to try our best to earn our better future. They are not like god who are inherently superior to us, and we never have 
the possibility to get close to them, which can discurages people.

Ronaldo will continue his great performance, and so does Messi. We, taking them as examples, should also try our best
to have a outstanding performance in our own stage, even there're great guys debuting now and again.
