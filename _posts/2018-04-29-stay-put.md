Mediation is something that someone praises a lot, but seems it is too quiet for me
to apply. But a frequent retrospection should work with the similar purpose.

Information era changes so much about how we interact with the world, and others. We're 
no longer needed as a person with shallow skill for many fields, but a deep skill for one or
two fields. Just as Unix's philosophy "Do one thing and do it well", it's more important to
focus on one field, and make consistent improvement in the daily manner, instead of skipping
around and sip a bit from here and there. Focusing and making consistent improvement are what
I take as my motto.

Bearing that in mind, I don't need to be upset by the overwhelming information around. Yes, it's easy
to be terrified by the sense of insecurity, e.g lag behind other guys, or miss something important, etc.
Or you are inundated with so many hypes, or you hear something you don't know but sounds so huge.
Yes, the hypes are always around us, but they just come and go, sometimes nothing left. And those hype-pursuers 
just switch to the new ones, while we might not need to be those guys, unless you live for that.

So stay put, stick to the goal, and make progress.
