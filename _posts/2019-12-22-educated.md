In my study, with a bad coffee, facing the screen of my computer, a cold winter afternoon,
some building is making noise out of window, my wife is snapping, and my daughter is doing her
exhausting homework with some fun and serious face.

It's kinda a boring afternoon.

After closing the book figuratively with my kindle, the idea just haunts around my head with deep
rage, or courage, or fun, or amazement, and all mixing together. It is undoubtely a powerful book that
I haven't read for a long time, and it doubles its depth and severity when it's a memoir.

Tara is surely a different girl, and even unimaginable in my mind, because that's the US, not a remote African 
village; it's near to the date today, not decades ago. But it's real, and it's happening, even though it does happen
in a remote town with big mountain.

She is growing with her big family, esp. her parents with so strong religion belief. They're against the modern civilization
by burrying and saving so much stuff for the incoming crisis, whatever it's from nature or from government. They homeschool
their children, keep away from government, and even the hospital, while keeping everything to themselves, like medicine, midwife,
education.

Everything appears to be normal if we hold the strong belief, and we are happy and believe in Lord, and the afterlife heaven.
But widening your eyes might introduce frustration, and doubts. You might start to doubt something that used to be normal. You might
want to resist or shout back that used to submit. You grab a book and read a different piece comparing with the one in your basement.
You start to spin around with your dizzy and heavy head. You fall down, and you climb up, and repeat. In darkness on the bed alone,
you might start to question yourself, and you throw you so many "what if".

Alternative seems to be not that remote and out of reach. You have examples before you. You try to approach the alternative, so you get
distant with your beloved parents, maybe not in space, but in mind.

It just becomes so much lonely and even deep sense of betrayal when your heart starts to doubt. That pressure is hard to relate to 
myself, but I can imagine the strength clouding around.

Alternative means goodbye to the original one, means sacrifice, betrayal, self-doubts. You no longer see the things as normal. You
want to shout back, or impact the original decent conducts. While they are still holding those belief, even much more tightly. You
just become the strangers, to them, to the old yourself.

Reconciliation is beyond the options. You belong to two different worlds, with your beloved parents, and siblings. You are distant in
heart, and also in space.

So what if you stick to the original path? You might get hurt in physical body, but might still be their good daughter. And like
an ignorant or illiterate person, they can be happy without any doubts in belief, even with physical body trauma. But when retrospection,
they might be satisfied with their path selection, even though they never had the chance or ability or perception to make the choice.

As Tara, the author narratives, we might be able to leave them alone in their own worlds. But education might widen your sight,
that's your luck, and it's also good to respect the ones stuck in their own world.

3 cups of coffee are brewing in my belly. The noise remains. I find I am a bit out of my thought. Do I really believe the two worlds are
equally same and leave them alone(or leave my daughter uneducated)? I won't for sure. I believe something joyable in a high level which
only education can bridge you there. So there's no **if not** for me as an alternative to **education**. That's the way we should go
and so do our kids.

She is still doing her homework with serious face, and sometimes rolling her eyes, or making a grin towards nothing. I guess that's because
she is able to imagine someone there staying with her, and that's what books or education might hatch out.
