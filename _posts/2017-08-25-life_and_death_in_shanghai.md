It's been a long time since the last article. This kind of laziness is not because I stop reading, but because I found it's hard for me to say something meaningful, something useful. So I just shut up and keep quiet, even though my study is full of books I plan to read.

While I decided to say something for this lady, for her tragedy, after reading the book. It's a book without yelling, but telling stories peacefully and calmly, while truth or reality always move you in the deep way along the reading, which is like you are walking within a late fall breeze, it's gentle, but you feel it exactly, and sometimes you even feel cold, or frozen.

Those ten years are gradually forgotten by the Chinese, since the victims have mostly died out, or other ones who underwent are not willing to tell for any reasons, and my parents never talked to me about this period at all. When I tried to ask them about this, they just hesitated and changed to other topics quickly. 

And also, this topic is still a taboo in mainland and you cannot access it in any possible mediums. Even it's mentioned, it's always been under scrutiny by officials, so as a citizen, you can never access the truth. Days ago, I went to HK, and visited several book stores, where books can be published more freely, and I checked some books about this history, including this one.(and bought another book named "Wild Swans" from ChengPin bookstore).

The story is simple and detailed what happened to the author herself and her daughter. It's so detailed, you know exactly what happened in the detention the author was kept. And you know how an ordinary people could be denounced, tortured and even starved to death. You were required to admit the denouncement which might not be the case, if you didn't, your families, your colleagues, would be asked to speak against you, or even say lies to put you in the non-existing accusion. This was just against the humanity, since it asked the closest family to accuse his/her family with a non-existing cause. If you refused to do so, you'll be tortured too, no matter physically or mentally. So Meiping(author's daughter) were murdered finally.

I don't want to talk too much about the story, and I just want to say something about the government and the people. People are always short sight and eager to the immediate reward, no matter whether it might affect your offsprings. So we need to have a good government which can play a role to avoid the tragedy to happen. The government should not be controlled by a few people or a single party, it should stand the interest of the majority. And even something goes wrong in a term, it can adjust and change back to the right track. With this, we and our offsprings won't suffer what the author has gone through, and can live a good life as we can.
