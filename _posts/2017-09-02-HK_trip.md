We planned to travel to Hong Kong for months, esp. my daughter wanted that so much, and as parents, you'd never refuse a kid's request if you can satisfy it. 

So packing our luggage, we firstly went to Shenzhen by Gaotie, which was a kind of tiring trip, and it took 10+ hours to arrive. Next time I guess train won't be an option any more, for the boring and long way to cover.

Finally we reached Shenzhen, which is where I have never been to, but really dreamed of, for its more open, or democracy feeling for all Chinese, esp. for its IT advantage over the rest of China. We stayed there for only 2 days, and visited a park near the beach, and had dinner with an old friend. Maybe I didn't go to the really cool place, the whole impression was not that good as I can remember now. Hot is the only feeling left to me for that city.

And we went to HK then. It was the first time for me to go to HK, and so were my wife and kid. We were excited, since HK is always a mysterious city for mainland citizens, and we almost all long for it, for its influence of movies, and democracy, etc. We passed the custom quickly and we entered HK! We had what we need by buying them from Taobao, and we were cool to continue the trip without any difficulty. Taking the subway, watching the scenes outside the window, we were close to the names we had seen a lot in movies.

After checking in the hotels, we took some walk around, and had some local meals. I am always open to any new stuff, so I was cool about anything, while my kid wasn't that cool for the food. Seemed she just wanted the food in our hometown.

We took the DingDing electrical bus to look around the city, which was slow, but interesting and cheap, you didn't need hurry, just took your time to see, or took some pictures. Then we took the boat to cross the Bay and arrived the Jianshazui, which might be the most famous place in HK.

Chengpin bookstore was a great place to visit, because we three love books so much. Checking out the books in traditional Chinese, or English, you just felt different. I took a book which was not allowed to publish in mainland, and read it for some time, which was really a fun for me. The books were expensive but sophisticated, and finally I bought a book about the history of a Chinese woman, which was not published in mainland.

The highlight took place next day, which was the visit to HK Disney. You might never imagine how enthusastic a kid could be when you mentioned Disney, or Mickey, or Princess Asha or Anna. The games were good, and the theater performance was splendid. Though the ticket was expensive, I did think it was worthy. We watched several performances and also played some games. She was so happy, and you can easily tell that it's a great and successful trip while you see her smile and curiosity on her face.

Next day, we went to the HK ocean park. And the games were so horrible, and I just took one, and never wanted to get close to it. I just closed my eyes and screamed nonstop during that time. It was a real relief after it just stopped and I fetched my stuff and went away with heart palpating so fast.The experience of watching the fishes, or penguins, or colorful jellyfishes was awesome. You couldn't move your eyes away from those wonderful creatures for one second. It was a pity that my kid was a little fever that afternoon, so we were out of the park early after taking a meal with sea scene.

The ticket we bought was for 2 days, so we went to Disney again, and had some great time there. Taking photos with princess, or squirrel, or Wenny, watching the play of King Lion was so great. And the parades, the fireworks, you know you get the right place with so many great stuffs.


Time flied fast, and we left HK days later, and went to Guangzhou to take the flight 2 days later. 

Guangzhou is a great place for having great foods, esp. their tradition of having teas morning or afternoon. The hotel we lived was near a famous restaurant which has more than 90 years history, and you always had to line up for the dinner. We went there and really enjoyed its sophisticated meals, dishes and tea. The impression to Guangzhou was good, since there're several bookstores in its famous street, and you can always meet that many young men there reading books. I love the guys who love reading, and I love the city whose citizens love reading.

We left Guangzhou and got back to Xi'an with a delayed flight, while we finally arrived home 3AM, and it feels good at home, for its familiar scent, and furnitures, and beds.


Tips:

1. prepare well for kids' medicines in case of illness
2. book hotels and buy stuffs in advance to get discount, or avoid the troubles
3. Disney or Ocean Park are really great, so never miss those places, esp. when you have curious kids
4. HK's room is bloody small, so bear in mind with that, or you will be surprised totally. (ignore this if you don't care the money.)
5. transportation fees in HK are really expensive, so exchange enough HK dollars and buy one BaDaTong in advance.
