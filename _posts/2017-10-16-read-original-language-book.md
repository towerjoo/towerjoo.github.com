The title seems pretty mundane, but for me, it's really a great step, since I start reading books in its original language, instead of the translated Chinese. Before this, I was thinking that might be impossible to read the original books, since it's very hard to understand the language, and then the plot fully and correctly if you don't manage the language that well. Therefore, I always say no to myself when picking up a book, with ~400 pages, full of small letters, just like worms. What strengthened my confidence was the last several months' English practice, including the intense repeated speaking practices, the new words' memorizing, talking to foreign teachers in an English club, etc. Months later, I got a book from the nearby library and never put it down any more when not finishing.

It's a novel with name "A tree grows in Brooklyn". I really love this book! I met and picked it just when browsing the GoodReads, and never anticipated to get book with the very best fit, but it was. It's an awesome book, since it always shines light on my memory of the boyhood. Though poor, bad clothes, even filthy smell for only one time bath per year, it was a great time with its own joy and fun. We could find and catch some repitiles, like snakes(why I am scared to them now?), lizards(playing with their tails), etc. We couldn't afford the apples, pears, peaches, but we could get them by exchanging with neighbors with our labors. I was able to watch the sky for hours, wondering, with mind wandering. I was able to stop by easily by the flowers, or the twitters of the birds. Then, Francie(the main character of the book) grew up, and we grew up, and are unable to be back anymore. We become fast-paced about everything, and we no longer take care of the litter beauties around, and take everything for granted.

So the first reading was really a fantastic experience for me. And there was a feeling which was very rare when reading the translated version, and I always cannot help worrying about the translator's taste of picking words. The feeling was awesome, and could be able to bring by the original author with the original language. At that moment, I just decided to read as more original books as possible.

So this experience led to a new chance for me, just like opening a new window, since there're so many great books which are only in English, if you cannot read, you just lost that opportunity to see something different, which is not what I want.

What should be the next original book for me then?
