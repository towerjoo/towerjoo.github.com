Hemingway is the writer that I love very much and enjoy reading his master pieces so much. He is some guy
who just reminds me the writers in Russian gold time, even though he is much later than those guys.
Everytime when I walk along the building I am working at, the painting of Hemingway in one of the offices just
makes me feel like he is there watching me with his profound blue eyes, just like an eagle eyeing at the prey.
But truly I am not his prey, his eyes just make me think of that automatically.

I love reading his books and I just finished this one, i.e "For whom the bell tolls". 

It's about war, while in a very different angle, and the whole story only covers several days in total. so it's 
very detailed in every nuance, not only about the people invovled, but also the thoughts they hold, and reasons they
live for. They fight for something, which might be different from the *enemies*, but the difference might be not that
important and cannot justify the war itself or the killing it caused.

The soldier was walking along the mountain, and he was shot, and his letters were found and read by Jordan. And as we
expect(or beyond our expectation), he has a lovely wife and several kids, and the worried parents who are asking about
his situations. He was not a beast, and he was not an alien, and he is just a human as we are. So he died, in a very young
age, for nothing. It might cause some discomfort in Jordan's mind but it passed very quickly, and he could jump out and focus
on the bridge blowing again.

Love or sex, Jordan never expects something in a war or in such an operation. But it did happen, so unexpectedly. Thus, it
becomes a burden, a responsibility he must shoulder. Finally, he couldn't go back to Madrid, back to the hotel, back as a 
professor, back as a husband, back with his beloved. He just stayed on that mountain, beside that tree forever. He might be
a bit relieved because at least she was walking away from the war, at least he didn't die alone.

Talking about cruelty, Pablo, how he treated the fascists, which are so vivid and cruel, are really beyond my imagination.
Though this is a fiction, I might say it did happen, or even worse did happen in human's history. It always amazes me how
cruel human treats other human, and also it amazes me even more that human as a species is still here and ruling the earth.
And then they fight back, they revenge, they treat you even worse. And the cycle continues, until when? Bell is about to toll
finally?

Everyone struggles for their own destiny, which seems to be out of our own control. We cannot say sorry, we cannot show sympathy,
we cannot compromise, and even we cannot feel, and we must be cold, deadly cold to others to make us survive, or for whoever's 
interest to fight for. Finally someone just dies along the way to desination, and someone finally reaches the goal, and rules
for a while, and gets killed sooner or later. It always spins nonstop, and people involved spin and struggle, with so much pity
and sadness.
