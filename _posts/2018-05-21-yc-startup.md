YC is a very special existence in the VC industry, and it seems it has a special personality, which
makes it attract so much attention and projects. As a person in a startup firm, I love a lot of things
from YC, incl.: their hacker news portal, the podcast, their startup events.

Last weekend, they had an event in Beijing which they anounced to enter China which could be a huge thing, 
because since then we just have a new entry to get financed and the attracting resources.

YC's enrollment is difficult, and the acceptance rate is very low. But once accepted, you will put all in
within 3 months in California, and try to roll out something which might fail or succeed to get another round
of financing. That tough 3 month is something I am really interested in. As one friend said, "startup is so prone
to fail even with your 100% effort, but most teams are not". Put all in, work hard in 3 months and see what you can
create, that is always a temptation for me.

There're some Chinese teams for YC's programs and the founders told some stories about their experiences, and what YC
can bring to them. They love that tough time and also the great circle of other founders/entrepreneurs around the world.
You can get advices from experts in nearly every possible field quickly. And each week's talk from famous entrepreneurs is
said to be very awesome for its candor and openness.
