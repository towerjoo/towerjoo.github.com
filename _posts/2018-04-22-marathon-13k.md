This week, I finished my 13KM marathon in Xi'an City Wall with the total duration 68'42''.
This is something I do yearly since 2011, which might be a 10K city running, or a 13K running.
While last year was kinda different, it was a half-marathon, i.e 22KM. That was really an exhausting
journey, and kinda overwhelming. So I prefer the ones less than 15K, as this one.

Xi'an is a good city in history and in books. It is famous for its being the capitals for dozens of dynasties 
in Chinese history, esp. the ones for Han, Tang. If there's a chance to travel back in time, I guess many Chinese
will favor Tang with no doubts. At that dynasty, we have so many great poets, and uncountable masterpieces, which
are still popular today. You can hide from public by living in the QinLing Mountain, or you can earn your own
honor by writing poems, or chasing governmental posts. Riding a horse, singing the poems loudly, gulping down wines with
friends, or just watching the moving clouds for an afternoon.

The good thing is that the city wall is still complete, which might be the same one as the one in the old dynasties. 
However, when you(esp. if you are a Chinese who knows some history about Chang'an) walk along the wall, take glances 
in different directions, remembe something that might happen in the same place centuries ago, get lost by immersing yourself
to the glamorous history...
