I really enjoy reading, whatever it's relevant with my career(to buy bread) or just for fun(novels),
or about knowledge(e.g economy, psychology, etc.), or a better understanding of the world and ourselves(e.g philosophy, 
sociology, etc.). Among all different types, we all enjoy the "just for fun" the most, but we might
not be able to spend as much time as we like. So we always envy the writers as they can just enjoy reading
and then writing as their career.

Writing about knowledge might be easier than "for fun", since it's more objective and doesn't need to have
a very tight criterion of words selection, but to convey the knowledge well. While for a novel, it's not only
about a good imagination/creativity/innovation of a good plot, but also about how to deliver it by words. So 
the readers care not only about the plot's novelty but also the beauty of the words selection. I guess that's why
it's so hard to become a novelist, which brings a benefit to be able to read for fun as career.

You might say the millionares can also take reading as career if they like. That is true. So finally we can close
it as: when you have enough money and you love reading, you can take reading as career. (so if a novelist cannot
earn enough money by writing, he might not be able to take reading as career either)

So I might not be able to be a novelist to take reading as my career, but it's possible that when I earn enough
money(it might not need to much), then I am able to take reading as my career.

I am looking forward to that day's coming. Surely it needs action. lots of sweat ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“
