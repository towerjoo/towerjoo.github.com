I caught with a fever 3 days ago. Someone said, "sickness can get you feel close to death, and think more about life's real purpose".
That's a good saying. When you are sick, you don't think you are invincible, and you will lower the value of money for a bit(and might 
only for a while). You will think human is so vulnarable, so weak, and we might die at any time. Then we recovered and forgot all those
kind of things, and consume our life with a unhealthy manner, for an irrelvant purpose. So maybe the frequnce of sickness can reinforce
this feeling, and I guess that's why when you get senior, you value something other more. Seems it's a pity that no one would like to
be sick.

With or without sickness, we can still read, esp. some intriguing novels.

For example, the present one I am reading: Shi ba Chun. I don't want to spoil the plot, but want to say something in general. Life is not
only about love or romantic, though it's a very important part, but it's also about feeling, understanding, communication, pain, happiness.
We make our decision that comes from that many channels, which means it's always not optimized. Then someone covers their mistakes, someone
learns from those mistakes, and someone never realizes them at all. So an optimized decision, rooted in human's inherent processing ability
(comparing to computers), sometimes is understandable to others, or even it should be forgiven otherwise you are too cold-blooded or nonchalant.
But shoud we? We can always find some reasons for any decision as the excuses, but it always brings pain/suffering for the takers. How can we
face them? Someone talks about the motive, and argues that whenever the motives are morally right, the outcomes might not be that important.
But who should weigh the outcome's importance? 

So IMHO, whatever your motives are, communicate at first before taking actions, and let the taker do the decisions instead of you. That should 
be the way to go.
