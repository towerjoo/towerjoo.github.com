So we have to say goodbye to this worldcup with some kind of regret, and some hope
for the next one. I don't want to talk more about the result, but I want to say something
about the players, i.e the **likes**, **dislikes**.

## likes

Ronaldo, Griezmann, Hazard, De Bruyne, Messi, etc. 

Let's focus on the match itself, and don't trick. Play with hardworking, gift, but not
exploiting the rules. Just like being a righteous man.

As a fan, we enjoy your gift to make something *impossible*, or your hardwork to do something
when your opponents are exhausted. Every rule in a domain has loopholes, and being a righteous man,
means we want not only win something but we want to win it morally good.

## dislikes

Neymar, Mbapp√©, etc. They are just the opposite. We cannot deny their gifts, but they don't do it morally
good, and just play with tricks to do their own interest, even making the whole game boring.

So they are close to the **likes** with only the tricks they play, if they could drop their  parts, and focus
more on the games, they should be better, and gain more fans for sure.

So, let's see what will happen in 4 years.
